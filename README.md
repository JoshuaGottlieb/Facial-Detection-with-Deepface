# Facial-Recognition-with-Deepface

This software will take a personâ€™s picture and compare it against a database of saved images. If it finds a match, some basic information about the found person will be displayed, along with confidence metrics for the match. If the person is not in the database, the software will report that the person is not found.
The software will provide a user interface, allowing the user to click to take a picture and initiate the facial recognition process, attempting to match the captured image against a collection of images stored in the database.
This software is primarily a proof-of-concept prototype. Its goal is to demonstrate the ability to provide a user interface, a facial recognition engine, and a database access layer working in tandem. This is significant in that it demonstrates the viability of this architecture for future use in developing a more industrial-strength version of the software.
From a technical perspective, the software will utilize user interface libraries, a database, image processing libraries, and a neural network for image vectorization.
