Selected the individuals with 3-4 images in the LFW dataset.
Randomly sampled 250 individuals (using numpy.random.choice with no set seed), totaling 846 images.
846 images were manually inspected. Images with low quality, extreme non-frontal face positions, objects blocking the face (hands, sunglasses, etc.), or extreme variance in brightness or light color between images of the same label were removed. If a label had less than 2 images after this process, all of the images for that label were removed. 504 images were left over, representing 156 individuals.
These choices were made to try to produce a biased sampling that have some level of noise control, as a real application would have much tighter control over the variables that go into taking images (pose, lightning, not wearing occluding clothing), without having to generate new images. With less noise between images, the distributions between the matched image distances and mismatched image distances should be more pronounced.
